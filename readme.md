# Overview
A library of primitives for automating PKI- and CMP-related tests using RobotFramework.

## Structure

- `tests` - the test suites themselves
- `resources` - reusable keywords written in RF or Python
- `data` - pre-generated test data (e.g., keys, certificates), if required


# Usage
Run `robot tests` to execute all the tests in the `tests/` directory.

Then explore `report.html` to see how things worked out.
